# PegasusNoteHandler
An application that handles the notes that are stored in a pegasus notes device.

This is more or less a steal from the http://pegasusscribble.sourceforge.net/index.html

It is a way to interact with Pegasus Technologies digital pen.

The problem with pegasusscribble is that it fuses the usb handling of the pen
with a nice application.
But the application is no longer maintained. And now it will not work well with
ubuntu unity.

I have a [Staedler digital pen](https://www.staedtler.com/en/products/ink-writing-instruments/ballpoint-pens/digital-pen-990-01-digital-ballpoint-pen/#id=35&tx_solr[q]=digital%20pen).

And I will have a go to make a haskell usb application that will do just two things.

    * will download the pages saved in the device to a .ps file.

    * will erase the pages saved in the device.

I just want to use my device offline and then to download the pages.
